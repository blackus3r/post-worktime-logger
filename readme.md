# Post Worktime Logger

Post Worktime Logger is a WordPress plugin that allows you to track the time you worked on each post.

You can find more information here. https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-worktime-logger/

## What does it do?

Post Worktime Logger will tell you how much time did you spend in a WordPress post. It will only count the time if you are actively working in the post, so don't worry if you have to leave the computer alone!

## Installation

1. Clone this repository and switch to the branch you want to use.
2. Upload /post-worktime-logger/ to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory in your WordPress blog.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

## Usage

Post Worktime Logger will start to track the time you spend in each post automatically as soon as you install it. You'll find the time in various places, such as the meta box when you're editing a page, or the posts list.

In the plugin settings you can edit the title of the plugin, and enable or disable if you want to let non-logged users to see it.
